Make a lunar phase calendar with Javascript. See at [https://guineo.org/lunitas/](https://guineo.org/lunitas/).

## 0.Intro

Generate a daily moon phase calendar in your browser using SVG.

## 1. Usage

Download all files and put in folder. Open luna.html in your browser.

Adjust the parameters and print. If you make a weekly calendar you may need to print on several pages and then tape or glue them together. It is also possible to export to PDF and then open it with a [vector editor](https://inkscape.org/) to adapt the design to your imagination.

## 2. To do

- Add solar eclipse, red moon and other predictions

## 3. Acknowledgements

This script is based on the BSD Games program pom by Keith E. Brandt. I translated part of pom.c to Javascript and added the SVG output bit.

Eclipses are obtained using code from the [lunar eclipse calculator](http://xjubier.free.fr/en/site_pages/LunarEclipseCalculator.html) by Xavier Jubier.
